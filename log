Wed, 15 Feb 2023 23:14:17 -0600| now, i think that ./supervisor/shared/filesystem.c contains the default files, that kinda sucks if it's in C, cuz coding it will be a pain^C

Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:19:18 -0600| ok idk why storage.erase doesn't do that, neither does reflashing the new flashing
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:19:45 -0600| those just take it back to the regular old hello world state
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:19:51 -0600| anyway after I install the nuke uf2
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:19:54 -0600| then install my custom uf2

Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:21:08 -0600| exists but unfortunately its kinda niche to flash the filesystem using the uf2 image. since it automounts tbfjust writing a script oughta be enough
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:21:09 -0600| anyways
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:21:11 -0600| my thing it
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:21:13 -0600| my thing is

Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:23:53 -0600
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:23:59 -0600| i could just stick it in code and call it a day too
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:25:39 -0600
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:25:52 -0600| copy examples/natmod/features1 for the c to py part
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:32:26 -0600
Thu, 16 Feb 2023 09:32:37 -0600| lib/tinyusb/src/device/usbd.c process_control_request looks interesting
